# OpenLANE_SKY130
For OpenLANE/SKY130 workshop 2021

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce audience to the openLANE - an open source flow to for a physical design of electronics. The main purpose of this project is to automate the design flow, from RTL to GDSII.

Currently, this workshop is designed around Skywater 130nm PDK, which was recently was made made open source.


## Day 1
This day is focused on introduction of the OpenLANE as an open source design flow.

OpenLane begins with initialization with `./flow.tcl` command run in main openLANE directory. This command would automatically run all design steps required to get legal GDSII file.

`./flow.tcl -interactive` will run the openLANE session in interactive mode, where each step of a design flow could be adjusted and launched by user.

Next step in interactive flow is `package require openlane 0.9`, which activates packages required for openLANE.

`prep -design picorv32a` will configure the selected cell (_picorv32a_ in this example) for a design by merging required LEF files.

Once the cell LEF file is configured, the cell is ready for Synthesis - one of the first major steps in a design flow.

`run_synthesis` command will launch sysnthesis process in openLANE.

## Day 2
The focus of this day was on floorplan and placement steps of the flow. 

Floorplan stage is required to place pins and non-standart cells on an area of a die.

`run_floorplan` is a command to run this stage. Additional switches can be used to customize the floorplan strategy, such as pin allocation.

Figure below shows the finished floorplan run with default configurations.

<img src="Images/Day_2/florrplan/1%20-%20floorplan%20default.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Floorplan generates a def file, fragment of which is shown below.

<img src="Images/Day_2/florrplan/2%20-%20floorplan%20def%20file.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Generated def file allocates mentioned die elements on a grid. Generated configuration can be visualized with _magic_ as a layout. It requires a PDK ***tech*** file, a cell ***lef*** file and a ***def*** file of a floorplan.

The next step is to allocate standard cells by running `run_placement` command. Similiar to a floorplan, the placement run can be customized with additional swithces if neeeded.

A finished placement run with default confogurations and generated magic layout shown below.

## Day 3

Focus of this day is on a custom cell layout and characterization.

_magic_ is a robust tool for layout visualization, design and characterization. For example, it allows to highlight the placed pins on a die, which were generted with custom floorplan configuration.

Moreover, this tool allows to characterize custom cells. Example bellow shows layout of the custom CMOS inverter layout. 

<img src="Images/Day_3/1%20-%20ngspice%20inv/2%20-%20inv%20layout%20in%20magic.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Some basic commands in _magic_ simplifies the operation and characterization of layout components. `what` _magic_ command is used to describe selected layout component, such as nmos.

One of the main features of the _magic_ is a layout parasitics extractions as a ***spice*** file.

<img src="Images/Day_3/1%20-%20ngspice%20inv/4%20-%20extracted%20spice%20file.png" width= "800" height= "600">

_ngspice_ is a circuit simulation tool, which can characterize electrical circuits in ***spice***, so it is a usefull tool to study the parasitics introduced by the layout imperfections. 

<img src="Images/Day_3/2%20-%20Sky130%20spice/1%20-%20ngspice%20file%20sim.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Extracted from layout spice file shows numerous sources of parasitic capacitances, so the timing performance of the inverter could be compromised. Capacitive effects could be characterized using transient analysis in spice with _ngspice_.

<img src="Images/Day_3/2%20-%20Sky130%20spice/2%20-%20ngspice%20tran%20output.png" width= "800" height= "600">

_ngspice_ point and click GUI is helpful  in estimation of capacitive dependant characteristics, such as delays, rising and falling times.

The reliability of obtained spice data will rely on the quality of the PDK files. 130nm technology is quite mature CMOS process, however only recently it was adapted to open source design flow. As a result, open source version of SKY130 is still missing some features of complete commercial version. Open source DRC library is not complete, but open source tools are avaialbe to manually update it, especially because official rules were made public by [Skywater](https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

As an exercise, some of the DRC were left out intentionally, so users can practice manually adjusting DRC library configuration file. For example on pictures below, the distance between polys and diffusion layers should be flagged by DRC as it is shorter than required, but it was not. Manually adjusting this rule (poly.9 for alldiff) resulted in proper DRC violation flag on the layout view.

DRC should flag more complex rules, such as area related, such as inadequate enclosed area or a missing overlap with a tap layer for a diffused wells. Both were manually fixed.

## Day 4
The first part of this day is focused on placing a custom CMOS inverter cell as a standard cell in openLANE flow. 

First thing, we need to confirm that IO pins of the circuit are approprietly locatedon a grid. As it can be seen on a _magic_ layout, input pin A and output pin Y are on a crossections of vertical and horizontal wires, generated by the grid.

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/1%20-%20grided%20layout.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Once the cell compitability with grid confirmed, we can generate ***lef*** file, so it can be used as a standart cell macro.

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/2%20-%20fragment%20of%20a%20generated%20LEF%20file.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Lets try to run synthesis with custom cell:

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/3%20-%20custom%20cell%20synthesis.png" width= "800" height= "600">

As it can be seen, the synthesis was successful, but we got a terrible slack. We can run synthesis with focus on timing performance optimization. By the default it is area optimized.

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/4%20-%20timing%20optimization.png" width= "800" height= "600">

We traded off some area for timing performance. 

Now we can see how floorplan and placement runs will place custom inverter cells as a standard cells. 

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/5%20-%20placement.png" width= "800" height= "600">

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/6%20-%20layout%20after%20placement.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Here we can see how our inverter cell became a part of a picorv32a layout (connected to a flip-flop).

<img src="Images/Day_4/1%20-%20timing%20modeling%20using%20delay%20tables/8%20-%20expanded%20vsdinv%20in%20layout%20after%20placement.png" width= "800" height= "600">

The timing performance in openLANE could be improved by several ways. One way is to configure additional synthesis parameters by restricting the fanout of a circuit elements.

<img src="Images/Day_4/Pre_sta/3%20-%20sta%20after%20max%20fanout%204.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Another method by manually replacing high-delay circuits identified by _STA_. For example replacing buffers 41881 and 44325 by a bigger alternatives improved timing characteristics.

<img src="Images/Day_4/Pre_sta/5%20-%20sta%20after%20replacing%2044325%20to%20buf4.png" width= "800" height= "600">


The next step in timming characteriation is clock tree synthesis (_CTS_). Due to the current limitation of SKY130 open source PDK, the CTS timing analysis is restricted only to tt process corner.

<img src="Images/Day_4/3%20-%20cts%20openroad/2%20-%20slack%20for%20a%20tt%20corner.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Similar to a STA, clock tree perfromance could be improved by forcing utilization of bigger clock buffer during synthesis.

## Day 5

The last day focused on power distribution network generation and routing.

`gen_pdn` command will synthesise PDN, once CTS is finished and libraries are configures. 

<img src="Images/Day_5/2%20-%20Power%20distibution%20network/1%20-%20generated%20PDN.png" width= "800" height= "600">

Next step is routing. As many other generation options, there are several routing synthesis options available for the `run_routing`. Typically, routing steps takes a lot of time, but depending on a selected routing strategy, the routing synthesis time or memory overhead could be minimized, in exchange for a final DRC legallity.

Once routing is finished, we can extract final SPEF file.
